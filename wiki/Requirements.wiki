#summary web.php requirements and dependencies.

= Requirements =

web.php depends on some classes found in the Zend Framework, and that's why it has the same requirements. The Zend Framework requirements can be found from [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/requirements.html here].

= Dependencies =

Our ultimate goal is to keep external dependencies at absolute minimum, but we have made a decision not to reinvent everything inside web.php. We have selected some of the Zend Framework components to aid web.php development.
