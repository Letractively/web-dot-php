==== Web::initialize() ====

`Web::initialize` method is called automatically when you include Web.php or call it's methods or properties (using `autoload`). `Web::initialize` is responsible of initializing static properties of Web.php class (PHP doesn't have a support for static contructors). As user you should never need to call this method directly.

==== Web::run(Array $urls) ====

==== Web::redirect(string $url, string $controller = false, mixed $data = false) ====
