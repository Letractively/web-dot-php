==== Web::initialize() ====

  `Web::initialize` method is called automatically when you include Web.php or call it's methods or properties (using `autoload`). `Web::initialize` is responsible of initializing static properties of `Web.php` class (PHP doesn't have a support for static contructors). As a developer, you should never need to this method directly.

==== Web::run(Array $urls) ====

  `Web::run` method contains web.php's front controller logic.

*Parameters*

`$urls`

  `$urls` parameter defines permanent urls used in web.php based application. `$urls` parameter is an Array with a key and value pair entries.

*Examples*

  _Execute `IndexController`, if application root is the requested url:_

  {{{
  // Creates IndexController class and calls it's `$_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']` method.
  // That is in most cases a GET() or a POST() method.
  //
  // `'/'` as a `key` means that this URL should execute a controller specified as a `value`.

  Web::run(array('/' => 'IndexController'));
  }}}

==== Web::redirect(string $url, string $controller = false, mixed $data = false) ====
