== Aapo Laakkonen (Vantaa, Finland) ==

Aapo is in charge of managing the direction of the web.php framework. He is the one that makes the final decisions on what to include in the framework.

== Matias Kirvel√§ (Helsinki, Finland) ==

Right now web.php is in it's early stages, and write access to Subversion repository is only  enabled for Aapo. After initial design and implementation is done, Matias will be able to commit code. Matias has an important role in making design decisions and he's the one that tests web.php and offers his opinions on what he likes and what he doesn't like in web.php. Matias is also a source of inspiration and his knowledge of other frameworks (e.g. [http://www.cakephp.org/ Cake]) really helps web.php.
